# General Anaesthetics

## Definition

> General anaesthetics are drugs that produce **reversible loss of all sensations and consciousness**, allowing surgical procedures to be carried out without pain, awareness, or memory.

## Classification

### 1. Based on Route of Administration

#### A. Inhalational Anaesthetics

- **Gaseous**: `Nitrous oxide`, `Xenon`
- **Volatile liquids**: `Ether`, `Halothane`, `Isoflurane`, `Sevoflurane`, `Desflurane`, `Enflurane`

#### B. Intravenous Anaesthetics

- **Inducing agents**: `Thiopentone`, `Propofol`, `Etomidate`, `Ketamine`
- **Benzodiazepines**: `Midazolam`, `Diazepam`
- **Opioids**: `Fentanyl`, `Remifentanil`

### 2. Based on Duration of Action

- **Ultra-short acting**: `Thiopentone`, `Propofol`
- **Short acting**: `Ketamine`, `Etomidate`
- **Long acting**: `Halothane`, `Isoflurane`

### 3. Based on Chemical Structure

- **Inorganic gases**: `Nitrous oxide`, `Xenon`
- **Halogenated hydrocarbons**: `Halothane`, `Isoflurane`, `Sevoflurane`, `Desflurane`
- **Barbiturates**: `Thiopentone`
- **Non-barbiturate hypnotics**: `Propofol`, `Etomidate`
- **Dissociative agents**: `Ketamine`
- **Opioid anaesthetics**: `Fentanyl`, `Remifentanil`

### 4. Based on Clinical Use

- **Induction agents**: `Propofol`, `Thiopentone`, `Ketamine`
- **Maintenance agents**: `Isoflurane`, `Sevoflurane`, `Desflurane`
- **Adjuvants**: `Opioids`, `benzodiazepines`, `neuromuscular blockers`

## Mechanism of Action

The exact mechanism is not fully known. Most general anaesthetics act by **depressing the central nervous system** through modulation of ion channels.

1. **Enhancement of inhibitory transmission:**
   - Many GA enhance **GABA-A receptor activity**, increasing chloride influx and hyperpolarizing neurons.

2. **Inhibition of excitatory transmission:**
   - Some (like ketamine, nitrous oxide) inhibit **NMDA receptors**, reducing excitatory neurotransmission.

3. **Activation of K⁺ channels (TREK-1):**
   - Leads to hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition.

**Overall effect:** Decreased neuronal excitability, particularly in the **reticular activating system**, causing unconsciousness and loss of sensation.

## Stages of General Anaesthesia (Guedel’s Classification)

Described for inhalational anaesthesia but conceptually applies to all.

| Stage   | Name                                         | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I**   | Analgesia                                    | Conscious, analgesia present, no amnesia.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **II**  | Excitement (Delirium)                        | Loss of consciousness, irregular respiration, reflexes exaggerated, involuntary movements.                                                                                                               |
| **III** | Surgical anaesthesia                         | Regular respiration, muscle relaxation, loss of reflexes. Divided into four planes based on depth.                                                                                                       |
|         | **Plane 1** – Light surgical anaesthesia     | - Eyelid reflex lost, but corneal reflex present.<br/>- Regular respiration begins.<br/>- Pupils small, reactive to light.<br/>- Movement may occur with painful stimulus.                               |
|         | **Plane 2** – Moderate surgical anaesthesia  | - Corneal reflex lost.<br/>- Laryngeal and pharyngeal reflexes abolished.<br/>- Regular respiration maintained.<br/>- Eye movement ceases; pupils slightly dilated but reactive.                         |
|         | **Plane 3** – Deep surgical anaesthesia      | - Intercostal muscle paralysis begins (diaphragmatic breathing only).<br/>- Pupils moderately dilated, sluggish light reflex.<br/>- Complete muscle relaxation.<br/>- Suitable for most major surgeries. |
|         | **Plane 4** – Very deep surgical anaesthesia | - Intercostal and diaphragmatic paralysis → apnoea.<br/>- Pupils widely dilated, non-reactive.<br/>- Marked fall in BP and pulse.<br/>- ~~Dangerous — approaching Stage IV (medullary paralysis).~~      |
| **IV**  | Medullary paralysis                          | Severe CNS depression, respiratory and cardiovascular failure, death if not reversed.                                                                                                                    |

**Goal:** Maintain the patient in Stage III (Plane 2–3).

## Phases of General Anaesthesia

1. **Induction:** Administration of anaesthetic to produce loss of consciousness.
2. **Maintenance:** Sustaining surgical anaesthesia safely.
3. **Recovery:** Termination of drug effect and return of consciousness.

### Balanced Anaesthesia

No single agent provides all desired effects safely. Therefore, a **combination of drugs** is used to achieve unconsciousness, analgesia, muscle relaxation, and reflex suppression.

| Component             | Purpose                                     | Example                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Pre-medication**    | Sedation, anxiety relief, secretion control | `Atropine`, `midazolam`, `morphine` |
| **Induction**         | Rapid onset of unconsciousness              | `Propofol`, thiopentone             |
| **Analgesia**         | Pain control                                | `Fentanyl`, `morphine`              |
| **Muscle relaxation** | Facilitate surgery and intubation           | `Succinylcholine`, `vecuronium`     |
| **Maintenance**       | Sustain anaesthesia                         | `Isoflurane`, `sevoflurane`         |
| **Reversal**          | Reverse residual effects                    | `Neostigmine`, `flumazenil`         |

## Adverse Effects (General Considerations)

Although specific agents differ, general anaesthetics can produce:

- **Respiratory depression** → hypoventilation, apnea
- **Cardiovascular depression** → hypotension, arrhythmias
- **Nausea and vomiting** during recovery
- **Hypothermia** due to vasodilation and reduced metabolism
- **Malignant hyperthermia** (rare; with halogenated agents + succinylcholine)
- **Post-anaesthetic confusion** (especially in elderly)

## Factors Affecting Anaesthetic Action

- Age, body weight, and general health
- Pre-existing CNS or cardiovascular disease
- Concomitant drug use (opioids, sedatives, alcohol)
- Acid–base balance and electrolyte status
- Rate and duration of administration

## Monitoring During Anaesthesia

- Vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature
- Depth of anaesthesia: clinical signs, EEG or BIS monitoring
- Neuromuscular function when relaxants are used

## Recovery

When administration stops, anaesthetic concentration in the brain falls due to redistribution and metabolism.
Supportive care during recovery includes:

- Airway maintenance and oxygenation
- Monitoring for nausea, vomiting, and shivering
- Gradual restoration of protective reflexes and consciousness
